## About Project

By combining Terraform and GitHub Actions, you can:

**Define Infrastructure as Code**: Define your infrastructure components, such as virtual machines, databases, and networks, in a Terraform configuration file.

**Automate Deployment**: Set up GitHub Actions workflows to automatically deploy your infrastructure whenever there are changes to your Terraform configuration.

**Version Control**: Keep your infrastructure code version-controlled and easily collaborate with your team.

**Infrastructure as Code Best Practices**: Follow best practices for infrastructure as code, including versioning, code review, and documentation.
